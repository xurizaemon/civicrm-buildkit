# civicrm-buildkit: Vagrant (deprecated)

For new Vagrant installations, please use https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-buildkit-vagrant 

This folder contains deprecated definitions for Vagrant boxes that include the
civicrm-buildkit.  These were highly experimental / unstable / buggy.  Do not
use them unless you've been specifically referred to them or already have
considerable experience in designing/developing Vagrant boxes.
